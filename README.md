## KPN SingleShop Frontend technical assignment

First of all thank you for considering working with KPN. We admire your efforts and respect your time, therefore we ask you to carefully read the project description and only work on the list of objectives.
The overall goal of the assignment is to create a minimal implementation that will showcase your preferred skills and approaches. To keep it simple we will ask you to recreate our existing page https://www.kpn.com/shop/mobiel/telefoons.

You can use our actual feed with phones for your implementation: phone_feed.json.

Your implementation shouldn't copy our functionality 1-to-1, so any creativity is welcome. It also shouldn't cover all existing functionality.
Scope of this assignment is your personal decision. You should keep in mind that your page is best seen as part of a bigger project. So apply all the best practices that are involved with such projects. Please note that nowadays 60% of our customers visit kpn.com from mobile devices. You are free in your technical choices, but if possible we would like to see a Vue based stack.

- What we would ideally like to see:
- A page with the list of mobile phones
- Header and footer could be skipped or simplified
- The page should contain filters
- Phones images could be replaced by dummy picture
- Color selector are not required (but it is ok to do it if you have extra-time)
- Code should be available on GitHub/GitLab
- Project should run with npm/yarn
- An API call that shows the retrieval of data (it could be served on your local node.js or mocked data)

# Time and Deadline

The scope is only one page, so do not spend more then 8 hours.
